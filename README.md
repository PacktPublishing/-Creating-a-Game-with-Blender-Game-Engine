This is the code repository for [Creating a Game with Blender Game Engine [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/creating-game-blender-game-engine-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788399746), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This video course introduces you to the Blender game engine. You'll learn about game asset modeling, game development theory, and how to use them to create a prototype game from scratch and then publish it online. You start off by learning the fundamental differences between the game engine and the standard rendering logic behind game decisions, physics, and optimizing models to have a good understanding of what a game engine is and how interactions work to make sure models run well in real time. Then you'll acquire a basic understanding of how game assets are created, including finding free suitable assets online, creating your own texture-painted models, and using the cycles render engine to bake realistic games. Next, you'll explore the basic workflow for creating a game from scratch, including planning, creating a basic environment, adding game assets, and finally giving your player movement and animations by understanding how to set up a basic game environment.

Building on this. we look at adding extra utility to the game—including special effects such as dust—and finish making a mini game by getting it ready for publication. Finally we go through optimizing and preparing your game for exporting so it can be played on any other computer and go through the basic process of publishing it to the online market.

By the end of this video course you will have an extensive knowledge of how the game engine works and how to use blender as a modeling/texturing tool to create characters and models for other game engines.
